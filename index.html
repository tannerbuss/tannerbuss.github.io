<p>I am a rising senior at Lehigh University pursuing a dual degree in financial accounting and journalism.  Accompanying my majors I am obtaining a minor in Africana Studies to educate myself in the interdisciplinary field.  Some of my involvement at Lehigh includes being a member of Theta Xi, Eta chapter, where I will be the Head Rush Chair for the 2017-2018 school year.  This position includes working with the treasuer to budget and plan events, and hold weekly meetings updating and advising on the fraternity rush process.  Additionally in my time at Lehigh I am an associate sports editor for the <a href="http://thebrownandwhite.com/"/>Brown and White</a>, which is the Lehigh University paper.  My tasks as an editor include budgeting articles with fellow sports editors and editing articles for the weekly paper.  I also report and write on articles to be published in the paper and in the website.  You can find some of my work by clicking the links below.  As well as being an editor I volunteer at the <a href="https://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/content/center-gender-equity"/>center for gender equity</a>.  During my time there I conducted a workshop for rush chairs and executive board members of other fraternities at Lehigh to educate them on promoting a more diverse and inclusvie enviroment in fraternities recruitment.</p>

<a id="My Goals" class="anchor" href="#My Goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Goals</h3>

<p>After graduation my goal is to pursue a career in international business.  During the summer of 2016 I had the amazing opportunity to participate in an internship in Bududa, Uganda.  During my time spent there I used the business skills I acquired to assist the local people in developing savings and economic growth.  My journalism degree will help me in the long run with my writing and editing skills, along with the valuable skills of researching and reporting.  Even though it is not my goal to pursue a career in journalism I anticipate the skills I learned through the degree to be some of my most beneficial assets.
